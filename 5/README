Project description: The game I want to build will be Pokemon themed. You will walk around one of the routes encounter different pokemon. You will have to either throw a rock at the mean ones or try to throw pokeballs at the good ones and catch them. It will be a top down game so you can walk in all 4 directions. Score will be kept by how many good pokemon you caught. You win if you catch them all before the bad pokemon make you faint. The sprites I have right now will not be final. Due to my VM unexpectedly crashing, I was not able to get all my sprites in time. The ones I have right now are from:
