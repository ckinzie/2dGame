Project no: 5 

Project due date: December 3rd, 2017

Project description: The game I am making will be a top down game about a pirate on an island. You will have to shoot the bad guys on your quest to dig up the burried treasure. You will wander around the island looking for a shovel to dig up the treasure and a key to unlock the chest. Once you've gotten those items, you can get the treasure and win. I want to make my own sprites, but I haven't made any I'm happy with so the ones I have for now are:

The easiest part of this project: Bullet pooling was not too bad, especially with the help of your video

Problems that I had in completing this project: Explosions gave me a bit of trouble, but I was able to overcome it fairly quickly.
